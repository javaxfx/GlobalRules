Warnings About Deleting a Repository in GitHub
You can delete any repository or fork if you're the organization owner or if you have admin permissions for that repository or fork. A couple things to keep in mind, though:

Deleting a fork does not have any effect on the upstream repository. Deleting a private repository will delete all associated forks, but deleting a public repository will not have any effect on the forks.

Deleting a repository will remove all wikis, issues, and comments associated with the repository. Once deleted, there is no way to restore a repository. Don't say we didn't warn you.
